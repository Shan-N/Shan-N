### 🗣️ The Manifesto

I don't write code; I compose performance. I spend 6 hours configuring my LSP so I can save 3 seconds of typing. I believe in **Memory Safety**, **Zero-Cost Abstractions**, and that `malloc` is a mistake.

* **My Editor:** VS Code (with Vim bindings, obviously).
* **My OS:** macOS on Apple Silicon. (Unix-based, because I need the terminal to be habitable).
* **My Current Obsession:** **Blockchain & Zig**. I'm putting the "Smart" in Smart Contracts.
* **My Moral Alignment:** Chaotic Efficient.

### 💥 The "Blazingly Fast" Projects

I build things that are faster than your attention span.

#### 🦀 **[CrabKV (The Rust Store)]**
*The Backend Flex.*
I looked at Redis and said, "I can do that in Rust."
* **The Stack:** Rust, Tokio, Sweat, Tears.
* **Why?** Because `async` is hard and I like pain.
* **Performance:** It handles concurrent connections faster than you can say "Garbage Collection."

#### 👁️ **[Perception Labs](https://perceptionlabs.tech)**
*The Frontend Flex.*
Most frontend devs use 50MB of JavaScript to center a div. I built **Perception Labs**.
* **The Vibe:** It looks better than your future.
* **The Tech:** Next.js optimized to the bone.
* **Verdict:** Go look at it. It's crazy good.

#### 📉 **DownWork** (Legacy)
*The System Architecture Flex.*
I built an Upwork clone from scratch. It worked. It scaled. I got bored.
* **Status:** Unmaintained (I moved on to lower-level languages).
* **The Lesson:** I can build full-scale platforms in my sleep.

### 🛠️ The Toolbelt (Vim Bindings ON)

If it doesn't have a dark mode and a CLI, I don't touch it.
